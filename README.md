The goal of this assignment was to create a data visualization from a chosen dataset.

Update #1:

Out of interest, I chose a dataset that I found on Kaggle which had information on food delivery times. I wanted to make a simple bar chart that showed the relationship between age of the deliverer and the time takemn to deliver the food. From there, I wanted to play with the intricacy of the graph itself. I decided to use the first 1000 data points to represent. For longer delivery times, I wanted to make a

I kept running into an error at line 9 of my code, where the command window indicated a syntax error. I played around with the names and could not overcome this issue. I also realized that a plot chart would have been more appropriate for this information, and maybe that is where my error was coming in.

Nevertheless, I tried to use the code from the tutorial of the loading process instead, and still ran into my error. This endured even with including "csv", "header" and excluding it. I also tried putting the headers here and was overall confused.

Update #2:

I was able to figure out my error, and wanted to again try my graph, altering it into a scatter plot this time as I felt that would better represent the data. I also made the points themselves into tiny pizzas to coincide with the food delivery theme. I was able to create the plot; however, I could not figure out how to make my chart larger for viewing or to shift it upwards to bo be so low in the window. I also would have liked to had labels to clarify the ages and delivery times.
